## rain cc drift

Compare the state file to the live state of the resources

### Synopsis

When deploying templates with the cc command, a state file is created and stored in the rain assets bucket. This command outputs a diff of that file and the actual state of the resources, according to Cloud Control API. You can then apply the changes by changing the live state, or by modifying the state file.


```
rain cc drift <name>
```
