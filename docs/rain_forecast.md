## rain forecast

Predict deployment failures

### Synopsis

Outputs warnings about potential deployment failures due to constraints in 
the account or misconfigurations in the template related to dependencies in 
the account.

NOTE: This is an experimental feature!

To use this command, add --experimental or -x as an argument.

This command is not a linter! Use cfn-lint for that. The forecast command 
is concerned with things that could go wrong during deployment, after the 
template has been checked to make sure it has a valid syntax.

This command checks for some common issues across all resources, and 
resource-specific checks. See the README for more details.
