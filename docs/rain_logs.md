## rain logs

Show the event log for the named stack

### Synopsis

Shows the event log for a stack and its nested stack. Optionally, filter by a specific resource by name, or see a gantt chart of the most recent stack action.

By default, only show log entries that contain a useful message (e.g. a failure message).
You can use the --all flag to change this behaviour.

```
rain logs <stack> (<resource>)
```
