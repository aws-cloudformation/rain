    ///  This parameter allows (per its [regex pattern](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex)) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@-
    ///   If an external policy (such as ``AWS::IAM::Policy`` or ``AWS::IAM::ManagedPolicy``) has a ``Ref`` to a role and if a resource (such as ``AWS::ECS::Service``) also has a ``Ref`` to the same role, add a ``DependsOn`` attribute to the resource to make the resource depend on the external policy. This dependency ensures that the role's policy is available throughout the resource's lifecycle. For example, when you delete a stack with an ``AWS::ECS::Service`` resource, the ``DependsOn`` attribute ensures that CFN deletes the ``AWS::ECS::Service`` resource before deleting its role's policy.
