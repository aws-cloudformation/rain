///   +  Resource-based policies don't support [drift detection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-stack-drift.html#). If you update a policy outside of the CFNshort stack template, you'll need to update the CFNshort stack with the changes.
///   +  Resource-based policies don't support out-of-band changes. If you add, update, or delete a policy outside of the CFNshort template, the change won't be overwritten if there are no changes to the policy within the template.
///  For example, say that your template contains a resource-based policy, which you later update outside of the template. If you don't make any changes to the policy in the template, the updated policy in DDB won’t be synced with the policy in the template.
///  Conversely, say that your template doesn’t contain a resource-based policy, but you add a policy outside of the template. This policy won’t be removed from DDB as long as you don’t add it to the template. When you add a policy to the template and update the stack, the existing policy in DDB will be updated to match the one defined in the template.
