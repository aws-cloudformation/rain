///   +  If you don't specify the ``FifoQueue`` property, SQS creates a standard queue.
///   You can't change the queue type after you create it and you can't convert an existing standard queue into a FIFO queue. You must either create a new FIFO queue for your application or delete your existing standard queue and recreate it as a FIFO queue. For more information, see [Moving from a standard queue to a FIFO queue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/FIFO-queues-moving.html) in the *Developer Guide*. 
///    +  If you don't provide a value for a property, the queue is created with the default value for the property.
///   +  If you delete a queue, you must wait at least 60 seconds before creating a queue with the same name.
///   +  To successfully create a new queue, you must provide a queue name that adheres to the [limits related to queues](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/limits-queues.html) and is unique within the scope of your queues.
