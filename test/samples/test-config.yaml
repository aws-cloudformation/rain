StackSet:

    # A description of the stack set. You can use the description to identify the
	# stack set's purpose or other important information.
    description: "test description"

    # In some cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack set template
	# contains certain capabilities in order for CloudFormation to create the stack
	# set and related stack instances.
	#
	# * CAPABILITY_IAM and CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM Some
	# stack templates might include resources that can affect permissions in your
	# Amazon Web Services account; for example, by creating new Identity and Access
	# Management (IAM) users. For those stack sets, you must explicitly acknowledge
	# this by specifying one of these capabilities. The following IAM resources
	# require you to specify either the CAPABILITY_IAM or CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
	# capability.
	#
	# * If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.
	#
	# *
	# If you have IAM resources with custom names, you must specify
	# CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM.
	#
	# * If you don't specify either of these capabilities,
	# CloudFormation returns an InsufficientCapabilities error.
	#
	# If your stack
	# template contains these resources, we recommend that you review all permissions
	# associated with them and edit their permissions if necessary.

	# CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND Some templates reference macros. If your stack set
	# template references one or more macros, you must create the stack set directly

	# capability. For more information, see Using CloudFormation Macros to Perform
	# Custom Processing on Templates
	# (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-macros.html).
	# Stack sets with service-managed permissions don't currently support the use of
